Title: CPMR0070 - Package Id uses underscores (nuspec)

## Issue

The package name (also known as a package ID) contains an underscore (`_`)

## Recommended Solution

Ask for the package, whose name contains an underscore, to be rejected by adding a comment into the Moderation section of the package page. Submit a new package that does not contain underscores. For example, a package named `my_package` should be named `my-package` instead.

## Reasoning

Package names / ID's should not contain and underscore. If you need to separate words in your package, use a dash (i.e. `-`).

There may be cases where an underscore in the package name / ID is permitted:

1. When the software that the package contains, has an underscore in its name. For example, the software is called `cool_software`.
1. The package is not a new package and has previously published versions.
